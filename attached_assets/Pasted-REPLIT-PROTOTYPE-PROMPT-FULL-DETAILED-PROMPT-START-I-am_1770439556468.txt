REPLIT PROTOTYPE PROMPT (FULL & DETAILED)

PROMPT START

I am building a working product prototype for a Product Management internship assignment.
This is not a demo app. It should feel like a real, early-stage ed-tech product with thoughtful UX, realistic data, and strong engagement mechanics.

Build a responsive web application prototype for an IELTS preparation engagement platform focused on destroying self-doubt through consistency, momentum, and visible progress.

Use:

React (preferred)

Tailwind CSS (or similar modern utility-first styling)

Component-based architecture

Clean folder structure

Realistic dummy data

No backend required (simulate logic in frontend)

The UI must not look AI-generated. It should feel like a real SaaS dashboard built by a startup team.

🔹 CORE PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY

The central problem this product solves is self-doubt during long preparation cycles.

The solution destroys self-doubt by:

Making consistency visible

Showing progress daily

Creating peer comparison (healthy pressure)

Rewarding effort, not just outcomes

Everything in the UI should reinforce:

“You ARE progressing.”

🔹 DESIGN SYSTEM / UI REQUIREMENTS
Color Palette (Professional, Calm, Serious)

Primary: Deep Navy Blue (#1E293B)

Secondary: Muted Teal (#0F766E)

Accent: Soft Amber (#F59E0B) for achievements

Background: Light neutral gray (#F8FAFC)

Cards: White with subtle shadows

Text: Slate gray / near-black

UI Rules

Clean spacing

Rounded cards

Subtle hover effects

No bright neon colors

No cartoon visuals

Professional typography

Dashboard-style layout

🔹 MAIN DASHBOARD STRUCTURE
1️⃣ HEADER

Display:

User name

Target IELTS band

Current streak (🔥 icon)

Notification bell

2️⃣ CONSISTENCY CHART (SELF-DOUBT DESTROYER)

Create a Consistency & Momentum Chart prominently near the top.

Show:

Daily activity over time

Momentum score trend

Clear visual proof of consistency

This section should communicate:
“You are showing up regularly.”

3️⃣ ACTIVITY HEAT MAP (IMPORTANT)

Create a calendar heat map similar to coding platforms.

Each day colored by activity level

Darker = higher engagement

Light = minimal activity

Empty = no activity

This heat map is a core engagement feature and must be visually clear.

4️⃣ DAILY STREAK CHALLENGE SYSTEM

Daily challenges must:

Rotate skills randomly:

Reading

Writing

Never repeat the same skill two days in a row

Be short (10–20 minutes)

Show on the card:

Difficulty

Estimated time

Start Challenge button

5️⃣ AI-TAILORED STREAK QUESTIONS (KEY FEATURE)

Streak questions must be adaptive.

Logic (mocked in frontend):

Identify weaker sections

Prioritize them in future streaks

Stronger areas appear less frequently

Display a small note:
“Today’s challenge is focused on improving your weaker area.”

6️⃣ MOMENTUM SCORE PANEL

Momentum Score =
Consistency + Accuracy + Weekly Time

Display:
